       The Diameter Overload Information Conveyance (DOIC) solution describes
       a mechanism for exchanging information about Diameter Overload among
       Diameter nodes. A DOIC endpoint is a Diameter node that acts as either
       a reporting node are a reacting node. A reporting node originates
       overload reports, requesting reacting nodes to reduce the amount of
       traffic sent. DOIC allows Diameter agents to act as reporting nodes,
       reacting nodes, or both, but does not describe agent behavior. This
       document explores several use cases for agents to participate in
       overload control, and makes recommendations for certain agent behaviors
       to be added to DOIC.

      <t>
       The <xref target="I-D.ietf-dime-ovli"> Diameter Overload Information
       Conveyance (DOIC) </xref> solution describes a mechanism for exchanging
       diameter overload information among Diameter nodes. DOIC defines the
       concept of a DOIC endpoint. A DOIC endpoint is a Diameter node that
       acts as either a reporting node or a reacting node. A reporting node
       originates overload reports, requesting reacting nodes to reduce the
       offered load. An overload report has a "type". The type of overload
       report determines the scope of the request for traffic reduction, and
       possibly other semantics.
      </t>
      <t>
       DOIC endpoints do not necessarily correspond to Diameter clients and
       servers. Any Diameter node that supports DOIC can be a DOIC endpoint.
       This includes Diameter agents, as well as Diameter clients and servers.
       However, DOIC does not currently describe how agents should behave as
       part of an overload control solution. This document explores several
       use cases for agents to participate in overload control, and makes
       recommendations for certain agent behaviors to be added to DOIC.

            abatement actions may involve local traffic reduction, or
            delegation of actions towards the client. Local traffic reduction
            can be achieved by either throttling a request or routing a

       Note that only two partitions of the Diameter servers are shown. This
       is bending to the limitations of ASCII art for drawing complex
       deployment scenarios. It is possible, and even likely, that real world
       deployments will have more that two partitions of the servers for
       a Diameter application.
      </t></list></t>
      <t>
       This document focuses on deployments that involve agents.  It is, however,
       important that any changes to the DOIC solution introduced to support networks
       that contain agents also work when there is no agent sitting between Diameter
       clients and servers.

    <section anchor="reporttypes" title="Diameter Routing">
      <t>
       Diameter supports <xref target="RFC6733">two primary methods</xref> for
       routing requests to a reporting node. Normally, Diameter nodes route
       requests based on the Destination-Realm and Application-Id AVP values.
       That is, they select the next hop from their Diameter route table entry
       that matches the realm and application of the request. For the sake of
       this analysis, we refer to requests routed by this method as
       "realm-routed requests"
      </t>
      <t>
       A Diameter node may also control the final destination of a request by
       inserting a Destination-Host AVP. When a node forwards a request that
       includes Destination-Host, it checks to see if it has a matching
       Diameter identity in its peer table. If so, it forwards the request to
       that peer. Otherwise, it follows the normal routing for the realm and
       application. We refer to requesta routed this way as "host-routed
       requests".
      </t>
      <t>
       When a Diameter node becomes overloaded, there typically must be a
       reduction of the number requests of both categories, in order to have
       the desired reduction of the overall offered-load. Typically the only
       way to reduce host-routed requests is by throttling some number of
       them. Throttling is best done as close to the request origin as
       possible. The originator is usually in the best position to
       intelligently throttle. The further from from the origin that
       throttling occurs, the more network resources are expended on routing
       and responding to requests that do not result in useful work.
      </t>
      <t>
       On the other hand, since realm routed requests are not targeted to a
       particular server, it may be possible to reroute them to other servers
       that are less overloaded. Rerouting should typically occur as close to
       the destination as possible (commonly at an agent). Nodes closest to
       the destination will typically have more knowledge about available the
       realm topology and capacity.
