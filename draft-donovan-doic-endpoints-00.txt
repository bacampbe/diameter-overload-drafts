               Analysis of Diameter Endpoint Alternatives
                           DOIC-Endpoints-01

Abstract

   The Diameter Overload Information Conveyance (DOIC) solution
   describes a mechanism for exchanging information about Diameter
   Overload among Diameter nodes.  DOIC defines the concept of DOIC
   endpoints.  A DOIC endpoint is a Diameter node that acts as either a
   reporting node are a reacting node.  A reporting node originates
   overload reports, requesting reacting nodes to reduce the amount of
   traffic sent.  The type of overload report determines the scope of
   the request for traffic reduction.  The current definition of DOIC
   endpoints is ambiguous, resulting in differing assumptions about the
   implementation of the DOIC solution.  This document describes two
   common interpretations of DOIC endpoints and analyzes how the two
   approaches address various Diameter overload use cases and deployment
   scenarios.

1.  Introduction

   The Diameter Overload Information Conveyance (DOIC) solution
   describes a mechanism for exchanging information about Diameter
   Overload among Diameter nodes.  DOIC defines the concept of DOIC
   endpoints.  A DOIC endpoint is a Diameter node that acts as either a
   reporting node are a reacting node.  A reporting node originates
   overload reports, requesting reacting nodes to reduce the amount of
   traffic sent.  The type of overload report determines the scope of
   the request for traffic reduction.  The current definition of DOIC
   endpoints is ambiguous, resulting in differing assumptions about the
   implementation of the DOIC solution.  This document describes two
   common interpretations of DOIC endpoints and analyzes how the two
   approaches address various Diameter overload use cases and deployment
   scenarios.

   DOIC endpoints do not necessarily correspond to Diameter clients and
   servers.  Any Diameter node that supports DOIC can be a DOIC
   endpoint.  This includes Diameter agents, as well as Diameter clients
   and servers.  A pair of DOIC endpoints that exchange overload
   information, as well as information about DOIC support, can be said
   to share a DOIC association.

   The two interpretations of DOIC endpoints and the resulting
   associations are summarized as follows:

   o  The per report model implies there is a DOIC association per
      report that can be originated.  With this model there can be
      multiple associations generated as a result of a single Diameter
      transaction.  See Section 5.1 for more information on this model.

   o  The node model implies that there is a DOIC association between
      each pair of Diameter nodes that support the DOIC solution.  With
      this model a transaction can only create a single association
      between any two Diameter nodes, but there can be a chain of
      associations between the originator of the Diameter transaction
      (typically a Diameter Client) and the responder to the Diameter

      transaction (typically a Diameter Server).  See Section 5.2 for
      more information on this model.

   The current DOIC specification [I-D.ietf-dime-ovli] does not fully
   specify the the semantics associated with the DOIC endpoint concept.
   It is also possible that additional syntax will be required.

   This document outlines an example deployment and multiple use cases
   that can be used to evaluate how those use cases would be implemented
   using the two assumed endpoint architectures.

2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   Diameter Node:  A Diameter client, agent or server.

   DOIC Endpoint:  A Diameter node that supports the DOIC solution and
      acts as either a reporting node, a reacting node, or both.

   DOIC Association:  The relationship between a DOIC reacting node and
      a reporting node.  A pair of associated DOIC endpoints share
      state, including information such as the fact that the opposite
      endpoint supports DOIC, the DOIC related capabilities of each
      endpoint, etc.

   Overload Abatement:  Actions taken by a reacting node to reduce the
      load offered to an overloaded Diameter node.  The specific actions
      required to perform overload abatement are described by the DOIC
      algorithm.  Overload abatement actions may involve local traffic
      reduction, or delegation of actions towards the client.

   Reacting node:  A DOIC endpoint that can receive overload reports
      from a reporting node, and perform overload abatement.  A DOIC
      endpoint can simultaneously be both a reacting node and reporting
      node.

   Reporting node:  A DOIC endpoint that can send overload reports to a
      reacting node, requesting the reacting node to perform overload
      abatement.

3.  DOIC Endpoints

   DOIC endpoints are defined in [I-D.ietf-dime-ovli].  A DOIC
   association is the logical relationship between a pair of Diameter
   endpoints.  A DOIC endpoint can be a reacting node, a reporting node,
   or both.  A reporting node is the entity that sends overload reports,
   requesting a reduction in the amount of Diameter traffic sent to the
   node.  A reacting node is the entity that receives the overload
   report, and performs needed overload abatement actions.

      A reacting node is also a DOIC supporting node that originates or
      relays Diameter requests, while a reporting node responds to or
      relays Diameter requests.  This is a side effect of the solution
      choice of imbedding overload reports in Diameter answers, but not
      Diameter requests.  Since Diameter supports bidirectional
      transactions, a node may simultaneously be a reacting node for
      transactions in one direction, and a reporting node for the other.

      This bidirectional nature makes it possible for a Diameter server
      to be a reacting node and for a Diameter client to be a reporting
      node.  There are multiple examples of Diameter applications which
      require Diameter servers to originate requests toward Diameter
      clients.  There are also examples where the Diameter transactions
      are between two Diameter servers, further confusing the concept of
      Diameter clients and servers.

   In the most basic case a reacting node will be a Diameter client and
   a reporting node will be a Diameter server.  When a Diameter server
   determines that it is handling too much traffic, it sends on overload
   report to the reacting node.  The reacting node is responsible for
   reducing the amount of traffic sent to the reporting node based on
   the contents of the overload report.

   In the more general case, a Diameter agent can take on the role of a
   reacting node that receives reports from upstream reporting nodes,
   and that of a reporting node that sends reports to downstream a
   reacting nodes.  This can be useful in situations where some or all
   downstream clients or upstream servers do not support DOIC.

      [I-D.ietf-dime-ovli] does not limit agents to only act as DOIC
      endpoints on behalf of clients or servers that do not support
      DOIC.  There may be other cases where operators may choose to
      deploy agents intermediate DOIC associations between clients and
      servers.  For example, to handle mismatched capabilities, or to
      reduce the number of DOIC associations maintained by Diameter
      servers.

   The DOIC endpoint relationship is established during the DOIC
   capability exchange.  The flow of the message establishes which
   entity is the reacting node and which is the reporting node for the
   DOIC association(s) established by the Diameter transaction.  The
   originator of the request message is not always the reacting node and
   the entity the originates the answer message is not always the
   reporting node.  This is due to the need to support a Diameter
   network that has a mix of node that support the DOIC extension and
   those that don't.  There are also report types being considered where
   agents are required to be the reporting node (both realm defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dime-ovli] and peer reports defined in [agent-overload]).

4.  Deployment Architecture

   This section outlines the deployment architecture that is used to
   evaluate the two DOIC endpoint architectures.

   This deployment architecture includes the use of Diameter Agents to
   route Diameter requests between Diameter Clients and Diameter
   Servers.  This architecture also assumes that the Diameter servers
   are partitioned in a fashion that requires Diameter requests to be
   routed through multiple agents.  All Diameter nodes in this
   deployment architecture are assumed to support the DOIC solution.

   [ben: Do we need to include scenarios with non-supporting nodes?
   That could easily force the per-report-type approach into a full mesh
   of associations.]

   Note that only two partitions of the Diameter servers are shown.
   This is bending to the limitations of ascii art for drawing complex
   deployment scenarios.  It is possible, and even likely, that real
   world deployments would have many more that two partitions of the
   servers for a Diameter application.

   Note also that this document does not discuss deployments that do not
   involve agents, as there is no effective difference between the Per
   Report endpoint architecture and the Per Node endpoint architecture
   with this deployment scenario.

5.  Solution Alternatives

5.1.  Per Report Associations

   The per report architecture implies that there is set of a DOIC
   associations for each report type.  For instance, in the deployment
   architecture illustrated in Section 4 there would be a DOIC
   association between each client and each server for the host reports
   that are generated by the server.

   There would also be a DOIC association between each client and each
   agent for realm reports, assuming that agents are responsible for
   sending realm overload reports.

   This discussion also includes the proposed architecture for agent
   overload.  This is done to further illustrate the per report endpoint
   architecture, as the agent overload draft proposes the introduction
   of a new report type.  Further extensions that introduce new report
   types would also add additional associations with the per report
   architecture.

   Figure 2 shows the associations that would result from a single
   transaction between a client, through an agent and to a server.  This
   diagram shows four associations being created.

   Figure 3 shows the associations that would result from a single
   transaction between a client and a server when no agent is present.
   There are no peer associations created as there is no agent involved.

   [ben: previous section said we would not discuss the no-agent cases.]

   NOTE: ADD TABLE SHOWING ALL OF THE DOIC ASSOCIATIONS THAT WILL RESULT
   FROM THE DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE.

   QUESTION: DO WE DISCUSS THE "COST" OF EACH ASSOCIATION IN TERMS OF
   THE STATE THAT NEEDS TO BE STORED?  IS THIS REALLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN
   THE TWO MODELS?  HOW IS SEQUENCE NUMBER AND VALIDITY DURATION MANAGED
   IN THE PER NODE MODEL?

   [ben: I think we have to consider state.  That will include at least
   the capabilities for each associated DOIC endpoint.  For stateful
   abatement algorithms, it may be much more.  For example, with a
   windowed algorithm, S might have to maintain a window for each client
   and agent in the entire network.]

5.2.  Per Node Associations

   The per node architecture assumes there will be a single association
   between adjacent nodes that support the DOIC solution.

   The per node architecture is illustrated in Figure 4 for deployments
   that include agents and in Figure 5 for deployments that do not
   include agents.

   With this architecture, all reports types are processed by the first
   reacting node that receives the report.  What the reacting node does
   with the report depends on the report type combined with local
   policy.  For instance, an agent that receives a host report from the
   server could do any of the following:

   o  If the agent determines that there is capacity in other servers
      that can handle the traffic reduction requested by the server then
      the agent can consume the report, with the mitigation action being
      to re-route the requested percentage of traffic to other servers.
      [ben: This comes perilously close to the RRR vs Realm discussion,




Donovan & Campbell       Expires October 3, 2014                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                 April 2014


      since it would normally be possible only for realm-routed
      requests.]

   o  If the agent determines that there is no spare capacity in other
      servers then the agent can generate an equivalent host report and
      send it to the client.  This report might be functionally
      identical to that sent by the server, but it is "from" the agent.
      In effect this could be considered passing the server report
      through to the client.  Alternately, if there is non-zero spare
      capacity in other servers, but not enough to re-route all traffic,
      the agent might calculate a different reduction percentage, and
      send a different "host" report towards the client. [ben: I'd like
      to wedgie the concept of "abatement by delegation" in here
      somewhere.]

   o  If local policy allows then the agent could always "pass-through"
      the host report without taking any other action.

   o  If the agent has a full view of all servers supporting the
      application-id then the agent could use the contents of the report
      to generate a realm report.  In this case it is possible the
      answer message could contain both a host and a realm report.

6.  Use Cases

   This section outlines example use cases.  Each of the endpoint
   architectures will then be evaluated against each of these use cases,
   showing how the use case would be implemented with that architecture
   and identifying any gaps in the current DOIC specification.

6.1.  Use Case - Basic DOIC Capability Advertisment

   This use case is included to illustrate the basic case resulting from
   DOIC Capability Advertisement where the servers advertise support for
   the lost algorithm.

   This use case is meant to illustrate the DOIC associations that are
   established as a result of the two endpoint architectures.

6.2.  Use Case - Basic Diameter Host Overload

   In this use case, assume that server S1 become overloaded and
   generates a host overload report.

   This use case raises the question of whether it is desirable for
   agent A1 to react to the host overload report.  The current DOIC
   specification assumes that the client always handles throttling of
   messages in this scenario.  The question is whether to agent should
   attempt to re-route messages to S2 if only S1 is overloaded.  If S1
   and S2 are both overloaded then it is clearly appropriate for the
   clients to handle any throttling that results from the host overload
   reports.

6.3.  Use Case - Missmatched Client and Agent Capabilities

   In this use case assume that client C1 supports a different set of
   DOIC capabilities then agent A1.  For instance, assume that client C1
   does not support the agent overload extension and that agent A1 does
   support the agent overload extension.

   This use case raises the question of whether agent A1 should insert a
   second OC-Supported-Features AVP in indicate the capabilities
   supported by the agent or whether the agent should generate a new OC-
   Supported-Features AVP that contains the union of the capabilities of
   the client and the agent.

6.4.  Use Case - Multiple Algorithm Support

   This use case is similar to Section 6.3 in that it is based on
   differing sets of DOIC capabilities.  However, this use case focuses
   on the case where the a subset of clients support only the loss
   algorithm, some clients support both loss and rate, servers support
   and prefer rate.  This implies that the server will select the rate
   algorithm any time that it sees a reacting node that supports rate.

   Assume for this case that the following is true:

   o  C1 and C3 only support the loss algorithm.

   o  C2 and C4 support both the loss and rate algorithms.

   o  A1 and A2 support both the loss and the rate algorithms.

   o  S1 and S2 support both the loss and rate algorithms and will
      select the rate algorithm any time that support is indicated by a
      reacting node.

6.5.  Use Case - Hidden Failed Server

   This use case, illustrated in Figure 6 explores the impact on the
   DOIC end point architecture of the case when a server (or more
   generally, a Diameter endpoint) that sits behind one or more agents
   fail.

                                 Figure 6

   In this case, other Diameter nodes will not have a direct view of the
   state of the server.  By default, clients attempting to send requests
   to a failed server will get an Unable-to-Deliver error response from
   the agent that sits in front of the failed server.

   It needs to be considered whether the best way to handle this
   scenario would be for the agent to generate a host overload report
   requesting a 100% reduction in traffic to the failed server and, if
   so, how this impacts the DOIC endpoint architecture.

6.6.  Use Case - End-to-End Security

   This use case is the same as Section 6.1 with the addition that it
   considers the impact of the likely Diameter end-to-end security
   mechanism.

   The assumption is that the security mechanism specified will specify
   that groups of AVPs will be signed -- to verify the identity of the
   originator of the AVPs -- and encrypted -- to ensure the privacy of
   the contents of the AVPS -- by the Diameter entities that insert the
   AVPs in to messages.  This will generally be clients and servers but
   can also be agents.  If this is the case then there are two
   alternatives that impact the DOIC solution:

      The DOIC AVPs are signed and encrypted.  If this is the case then
      there are impacts to the solution for Section 6.1 as there would
      be no means for agents to modify the existing contents of an OC-
      Supported-Features AVP.

      Note: This is not strictly true if the agent has access to the
      shared secret keys needed to decrypt the AVPs.  If this is the
      case then clients and servers would need to understand that agents
      can change (and thus sign) AVPs if the pre-report architecture is
      selected.  If the per-node architecture is selected then proxies
      wuld always be required to be able to decrypt received DOIC AVPs
      and encrypt DOIC AVPs in messages they forward.

      The DOIC AVPs are not signed and encrypted.  This is a less secure
      mechanism that does introduce exposure in the general sense as
      insertion of OLR AVPs by a rouge element is an effective denial of
      service attack.  Signing of the OLR AVPs is likely to be the the
      most effective mechanism to address this security risk.

7.1.1.  Basic Capability Exchange

   Figure 7 illustrates the message flow associated with this use case
   when using the per-report-type endpoint architecture.  This use case

   and realm overload report will be generated by the agent.

                                 Figure 7

   The per-report-type architecture implies that each DOIC aware node
   must learn the capabilities of each node with which it shares an
   association.  That is, S must learn the capabilities of C and A, C
   must learn of A and S, and A must learn of C and S. Since DOIC
   [I-D.ietf-dime-ovli] requires each endpoint to insert its
   capabilities into every Diameter message, A must insert its own OC-
   Supported-Features AVP into the messages that traverse it, while
   preserving that sent by C or S. This further implies that C and S
   must be prepared to receive multiple OC-Supported-Feature values, and
   be able to determine the identity of the source of each one.

   Additionally, each DOIC endpoint must keep state to remember the
   capabilities of each endpoint with which it shares a DOIC
   association.  In this example, those associations are fully meshed.
   While this example shows a trivial network, the number of
   associations can become very large in larger networks.

7.1.2.  Basic Host Overload

   This use case is illustrated in Figure 7.

   The per-report-type architecture assumes that all "host" overload
   reports are handled by clients, except in cases where agents handle
   host reports on behalf of clients that do not support DOIC.  There is
   no DOIC association between A and S.

   [Issue: That doesn't seem right--are we beating a straw man here?  Is
   there really no association between A and S?]

   This brings up a question about how agents might learn of server
   overload conditions in order to generate "realm" reports.  One
   possibility is that they inspect host reports in passing, and use
   those reports in combination with their local knowledge of server
   topology to infer the state of the realm as a whole.  But since the
   server has an host-report association with each client, the agent
   cannot assume that a host-report destined for any one client is valid
   for any other client.  This makes it much more difficult for an agent
   to draw inferences about the state of the realm as a whole.

   ISSUE: What is the correct definition of host overload.  The current
   draft ([I-D.ietf-dime-ovli]) defines host overload as any request
   that contains a Destination-Host AVP that matches the host indicated
   in the overload report.  [Ben: Isn't that what we landed on?]

7.1.3.  Mismatched Capabilities

   QUESTION: IS THIS REALLY A ENDPOINT DEFINITION ISSUE OR SHOULD IT BE
   HANDLED SEPARATELY?  [Ben: I think we need discussion about whether
   the per-report-type model has any A-S association.  I think we may be
   dividing the models along the wrong dimension.]  [Ben: Is this any
   different that a less-painful version of the mixed algorithm
   problem?]
